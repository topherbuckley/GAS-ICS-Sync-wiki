### Before submitting a new issue, please try these things:

1. Check to see if you're on the latest version (look at the `Helpers.gs` file and near the bottom there is a line like `var thisVersion = 5.3;`. Compare that with the latest release version listed here: https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync/releases

2. Check to see if your issue is already listed at https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync/issues . If it is - there may already be a suggested solution there!

3. If your issue is not listed, you can try searching for it in the full list https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync/issues?q=is%3Aissue . Not all issue resolutions become actual code changes in the program. Sometimes if it's just a couple people encountering an issue because of their specific setup (a custom timezone, weird ics formatting, etc) then we just give them a solution and close the issue - we don't always make changes to the program.

4. Finally, if none of the above steps work for you, report a new issue at https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync/issues/new/choose . Make sure to include good information, like:

    - An ICS file that demonstrates the issue (if you are worried about privacy of your calendar, you can use the [ICS Sanitizer](https://derekantrican.github.io/icssanitizer.html) that I wrote)
    - Any relevant screenshots
    - Does the problem also exist if you use Google Calendar to subscribe to the calendar (you can do that following the instructions here: https://help.sportlyzer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207593579-Add-iCal-to-Google-Calendar)
